## Hello World!

Welcome to my humble blog! Here, I aim to showcase my journey into the exciting realms of software engineering and ethical hacking.

This blog is directly exported from my [Obsidian.md database](https://github.com/LorenzoDOrtiz/obsidian-vault) and published using GitHub Pages!

As I navigate through the vast landscape of technology, this blog will evolve, providing you with a firsthand account of my experiences. I'm enthusiastic about sharing my insights and discoveries, hoping to offer you valuable perspectives along the way.

Feel free to explore and join me on this adventure!
